# Managing Collections

When your state includes large collections like `Vec`, `String`, or `HashMap`, performance can become an issue. Each time you update the state, EaseRx clones it to pass to the reducer. For large collections, this cloning operation can be very expensive.

This chapter, based on the `basic3_collections` example (run with `just b3`), demonstrates two methods for managing collections, highlighting the recommended and more performant approach.

## The Challenge: Costly Clones

Let's consider a state containing a large vector:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
struct CollectionState {
    vec: Vec<usize>,
    // ...
}
impl State for CollectionState {}
```

If we want to add an element to this vector, the standard immutable approach is to clone the entire state, push the element to the vector in the newly cloned state, and then return it.

```rust
// Reducer function
|mut state| {
    state.vec.push(new_element);
    state
}
```

If `state.vec` contains thousands of elements, the `state.clone()` operation inside the `set_state` call will be slow. The `basic3_collections` example benchmarks this, showing it consumes significant time.

## The Solution: Interior Mutability with `Arc`

A much more performant pattern is to wrap the collection in `Arc` and `Mutex` (or `RwLock`). This is a form of interior mutability.

Now our state looks like this:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
struct CollectionState {
    arc_vec: Arc<Mutex<Vec<usize>>>,
    // ...
}
impl State for CollectionState {}
```

Now, when we want to add an element, our reducer will be different:

```rust
// Reducer function
|state| {
    state.arc_vec.lock().unwrap().push(new_element);
    state // We return the original state struct
}
```

### Why is this Faster?

1.  **No Deep Clone**: When `set_state` clones `CollectionState`, it only clones the `Arc`. This is a very low-overhead operation as it merely increments the reference count. The large vector data on the heap is **not** cloned.
2.  **In-Place Modification**: The reducer locks the `Mutex` and modifies the vector in place.

The `basic3_collections` example benchmarks `Vec`, `String`, and `HashMap`, and in all cases, the `Arc`-wrapped versions are significantly faster than cloning the entire collection on every update.

## Recommendation

For any large or frequently updated collections within your state, it is highly recommended to wrap them in `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or `Arc<RwLock<T>>`.

- If you have multiple writers or simple write operations, `Mutex` is recommended.
- If you have multiple readers and a few writers, `RwLock` is recommended as it allows multiple concurrent reads.

This pattern gives you the best of both worlds: structured state management with EaseRx and high performance for in-place modifications of large data structures.
