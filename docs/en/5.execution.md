# Execution

A core feature of EaseRx is its ability to manage side effects and long-running tasks without blocking the main application logic. This is achieved through a series of `execute` methods on the `StateStore`. These methods handle the entire lifecycle of an operationâ€”from indicating a loading state to updating the state with the final result (`Success` or `Fail`).

## Core Principles

All `execute` functions follow similar principles:

1.  They immediately update the corresponding `Async<T>` field in your state to `Async::Loading`.
2.  They spawn a new Tokio task to run your computation (either a synchronous function or an asynchronous future).
3.  Once the computation completes, they update the `Async<T>` field again with the result (`Async::Success` or `Async::Fail`).

This ensures your application remains responsive and the state always reflects the current status of the operation.

## Synchronous Execution

For CPU-bound or blocking I/O tasks, it's recommended to use synchronous execution methods. These methods run your function on a blocking thread pool (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`), preventing it from slowing down the asynchronous runtime.

- `execute(computation, updater)`: The basic method for synchronous execution.

  ```rust
  store.execute(
      || {
          // A potentially long-running, blocking computation
          std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
          compute_heavy_stuff() // Returns Result<T, E> or Option<T>
      },
      |mut state, result| {
          state.data = result;
          state
      }
  );
  ```

## Asynchronous Execution

For I/O-bound tasks that are inherently `async` (such as database queries or API calls), it's recommended to use asynchronous execution methods.

- `async_execute(computation, updater)`: The basic method for asynchronous execution.

  ```rust
  store.async_execute(
      async {
          // An asynchronous operation
          fetch_data_from_api().await // Returns Result<T, E> or Option<T>
      },
      |mut state, result| {
          state.data = result;
          state
      }
  );
  ```

## `execute` Method Variants

The `execute` methods have several variants that add special functionality.

### `_with_retain`

- **`execute_with_retain`**
- **`async_execute_with_retain`**

These methods retain the previous `Success` value when transitioning to the `Loading` state. This is ideal for UI scenarios where you want to display old data while new data is being fetched.

```rust
store.execute_with_retain(
    || compute_stuff(),
    |state| &state.data, // Getter for the Async<T> field
    |mut state, result| {
        state.data = result;
        state
    }
);
```

### `_cancellable`

- **`execute_cancellable`**
- **`async_execute_cancellable`**

These methods accept a `CancellationToken`, allowing you to cancel the operation while it's in progress. If canceled, the state will be updated to `Async::Fail { error: AsyncError::Cancelled, .. }`.

```rust
use tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken;

let token = CancellationToken::new();

store.execute_cancellable(
    token.clone(),
    |cancel_token| { // The computation receives the token
        // ... periodically check the token ...
    },
    |mut state, result| { /* ... */ }
);

// How to cancel:
token.cancel();
```

### `_cancellable_with_retain`

- **`execute_cancellable_with_retain`**
- **`async_execute_cancellable_with_retain`**

These methods combine cancelability with the retain feature. They keep the previous `Success` value when transitioning to the `Loading` state and allow cancellation while the operation is in progress.

### `_with_timeout`

- **`execute_with_timeout`**
- **`async_execute_with_timeout`**

These methods accept a `Duration`, automatically canceling the operation if it doesn't complete within the specified time. The state will be updated to `Async::Fail { error: AsyncError::Timeout, .. }`.

```rust
store.async_execute_with_timeout(
async { fetch_data().await },
Duration::from_secs(5), // 5-second timeout
|mut state, result| { /* ... */ }
);
```
