# Cancellable Execution

This example is based on `extended3_execute_with_cancelable` and uses `just e3` to run it. It demonstrates how to implement active task cancellation using the `execute_cancellable` method of StateStore, improving system responsiveness and user experience.

**Note**: `extended7_async_execute_with_cancelable` is the asynchronous version, use `just e7` to run this example.

## Usage

- Applicable to scenarios where users or the system need to actively cancel tasks during execution.
- Commonly used in network requests, long-running computations, interactive applications, etc.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
store_clone.execute_with_timeout(
            heavy_computation,
            Duration::from_millis(2000),
            |state, num| {
                debug!("Worker | update num: {:?}", num);
                Counter { num, ..state }
            },
        );
```

## Complete Flow

- During normal execution, the state flow will go through Loading -\> Success.
- When actively cancelled, the state flow will go through Loading -\> Fail (Cancelled). This can be checked using `is_fail_with_canceled()`.
- Supports various cancellation methods, including cancellation from the main thread and within the computation closure.

```rust
let cancellation_token = CancellationToken::new();
let control_token = cancellation_token.clone();

store.execute_cancellable(
    cancellation_token,
    |token| heavy_computation_cancellable(token),
    |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
);
// Cancel from the main thread
control_token.cancel();
```

## Notes

- The computation closure needs to regularly check `cancellation_token.is_cancelled()` to respond to cancellations promptly.
- After cancellation, it is recommended to promptly handle cleanup logic to avoid resource leaks.
