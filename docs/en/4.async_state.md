# AsyncState

When dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API or running a long-running computation, you need to manage more than just the final result; you also need to track loading and error states. `Async<T>` is an enum designed specifically for this purpose.

## The `Async<T>` Enum

`Async<T>` is a generic enum that represents the complete lifecycle of an asynchronous operation. `T` is the type of the successful result.

It has four variants:

- `Uninitialized`: The initial state. The operation has not yet started.
- `Loading { value: Option<T> }`: The operation is in progress. It can optionally hold a `value` from a previously successful operation. This is useful for "retain-on-reload" UI patterns, where old data is displayed while new data is being loaded.
- `Success { value: T }`: The operation completed successfully, and `value` contains the result.
- `Fail { error: AsyncError, value: Option<T> }`: The operation failed. It contains an `AsyncError` detailing the reason for the failure and can also retain a `value` from a previous success.

## Usage in State

Typically, you'll include `Async<T>` as a field within your main state struct to represent asynchronously loaded data.

```rust
use easerx::{Async, State};

#[derive(Clone, Default)]
struct MyState {
    user_profile: Async<UserProfile>,
    // ... 其他状态字段
}

impl State for MyState {}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct UserProfile {
    id: u64,
    name: String,
}
```

## Working with `Async<T>`

The `Async<T>` enum provides a rich set of helper methods to make it easy to use.

### Checking State

You can easily check the current state of the operation:

- `is_uninitialized()`
- `is_loading()`
- `is_success()`
- `is_fail()`
- `is_complete()` (true for `Success` or `Fail`)

<!-- end list -->

```rust
let user_profile_state: Async<UserProfile> = // ... fetch from store

if user_profile_state.is_loading() {
    // 显示加载指示器
}
```

### Accessing Values

You can extract the value from `Async<T>` regardless of its state:

- `value()`: Consumes `Async` and returns an `Option<T>`. It returns `Some(value)` if the state is `Success`, or `Loading` or `Fail` with a retained value.
- `value_ref()`: Returns an `Option<&T>` without consuming `Async`.
- `value_ref_clone()`: Returns a cloned `Option<T>`.

This is convenient for rendering UIs, as you can often display a value whether the state is `Loading`, `Success`, or `Fail`.

```rust
if let Some(profile) = user_profile_state.value_ref() {
    // 显示用户名，即使是在重新加载期间的旧数据
    println!("User: {}", profile.name);
}
```

### Handling Failures

The `Fail` variant contains an `AsyncError`, which is another enum specifying the type of error:

- `Cancelled`
- `Timeout`
- `None` (e.g., when an `Option` computation returns `None`)
- `Error(String)` (for general errors)

You can use methods like `is_fail_with_canceled()` or `is_fail_with_timeout()` to handle specific failure scenarios.

`Async<T>` is a cornerstone for managing side effects in EaseRx, working in conjunction with the `execute` family of functions on `StateStore`.
