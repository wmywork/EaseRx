# Cancellable Execution with Retention

This example is based on `extended4_execute_cancelable_with_retain` and demonstrates how to use the `execute_cancellable_with_retain` method of StateStore to support task cancellation while retaining the last valid value. Run this example with `just e4`.

**Note**: `extended8_async_execute_cancelable_with_retain` is the asynchronous version of this example, run it with `just e8`.

## Usage

- Suitable for scenarios where tasks need to be cancellable, and the UI/state should still display the last valid data after cancellation.
- Commonly used in data refreshing, retries, network requests, etc., to enhance user experience.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
let cancellation_token = CancellationToken::new();
store.execute_cancellable_with_retain(
    cancellation_token.clone(),
    |token| heavy_computation_cancellable(token),
    |state| &state.num,
    |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
);
// cancellation_token.cancel(); can be called anytime when needed.
```

## Complete Flow

- In normal execution, the state flow goes from Loading -\> Success.
- Upon active cancellation, the state flow goes from Loading -\> Fail (cancellation), but the last successful value will be retained.
- Supports various cancellation methods, including cancellation from the main thread and within the computation closure.

```rust
let cancellation_token = CancellationToken::new();
let control_token = cancellation_token.clone();

store.execute_cancellable_with_retain(
    cancellation_token,
    |token| heavy_computation_cancellable(token),
    |state| &state.num,
    |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
);
// Cancel from the main thread
control_token.cancel();
```

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the state implements `Clone` and the retained field type supports cloning.
- The computation closure should regularly check `cancellation_token.is_cancelled()` to respond to cancellations promptly.
- It is recommended to handle cleanup logic promptly after cancellation to avoid resource leaks.
