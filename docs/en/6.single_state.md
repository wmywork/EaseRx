# Single State Management

This example demonstrates EaseRx's most basic use case: managing a single piece of state. We will build a simple counter, focusing on how to create a store, update its state, and listen for changes.

This section is based on the `basic1_state_store` example, use `just b1` to run this example.

## State

We define a `Counter` struct to hold the count value. It must be `Clone`, and we also derive `Default` for easy initialization. Crucially, it must implement the `State` marker trait.

```rust
use easerx::State;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
struct Counter {
    count: i32,
}

impl State for Counter {}

impl Counter {
    // A helper method for immutable updates
    fn add_count(self, value: i32) -> Self {
        Self {
            count: self.count + value,
        }
    }
}
```

## Application Logic

In our `main` function, we perform the following steps:

1.  **Create the Store**: We initialize a `StateStore` with `Counter::default()` and wrap it in an `Arc`.
2.  **Enqueue Operations**: We use `with_state` to read the initial state and `set_state` to increment the counter. These operations are sent to a background worker task.
3.  **Wait and Verify**: We use `tokio::time::sleep` to give the worker task some time to process the updates, then `await_state` to get the latest state and confirm it has been updated.
4.  **React with Signals**: We demonstrate the reactive nature of the store by converting it to a signal via `to_signal()`. We then use `for_each` to print every change to the state. The signal is set to stop once the count value exceeds 100.
5.  **Simulate Concurrent Updates**: We spawn a separate Tokio task to rapidly update the state, demonstrating how the signal handles a stream of changes.

```rust
use easerx::{StateStore, AsyncError};
use futures_signals::signal::SignalExt;
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::time::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // 1. Create the store
    let store = Arc::new(StateStore::new(Counter::default()));

    // 2. Enqueue operations
    store.with_state(|state| {
        println!("Initial state: {:?}", state);
    })?;

    store.set_state(|state| state.add_count(1))?;

    // 3. Wait and verify
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(10)).await;
    let current_state = store.await_state().await?;
    println!("Updated state: {:?}", current_state); // Should be Counter { count: 1 }

    // 5. Simulate concurrent updates
    let store_clone = store.clone();
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
        warn!("State is lossy, it may skip some changes");
        for _ in 0..=5 {
            store_clone.set_state(|state| state.add_count(10))?;
        }

        for _ in 0..=5 {
            sleep(Duration::from_millis(10)).await;
            store_clone.set_state(|state| state.add_count(10))?;
        }
        Ok::<(), AsyncError>(())
    });

    // 4. React with signals
    println!("Listening for state changes...");
    store
        .to_signal()
        .stop_if(|state| state.count > 100)
        .for_each(|state| {
            println!("State changed to: {:?}", state);
            async {}
        })
        .await;

    println!("Done.");
    Ok(())
}
```

This example covers the complete, basic workflow: defining state, creating a store, modifying state, and reactively listening for those changes.

- **Note**: State changes may skip some intermediate states, especially during high-frequency updates, as signals are lossy. Therefore, consider this when designing your application.
