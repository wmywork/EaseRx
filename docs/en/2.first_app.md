# Your First Application

Let's build a simple counter application to understand the basic concepts of EaseRx. This example will demonstrate how to define state, create a store, update state, and react to its changes.

We will walk through the `basic1_state_store` example step-by-step.

## 1\. Defining the State

First, we define a struct to hold the application's state. For this counter, we only need an `i32` field.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
struct Counter {
    count: i32,
}
```

To use this struct with EaseRx, it must implement the `State` trait. This is a marker trait indicating its role as a state model.

```rust
use easerx::State;

impl State for Counter {}
```

We also add a method to the struct to update the counter value. This method takes ownership of `self` and returns a new `Counter` instance, which is a common pattern for immutable state updates.

```rust
impl Counter {
    fn add_count(self, value: i32) -> Self {
        Self {
            count: self.count + value,
        }
    }
}
```

## 2\. Creating the StateStore

`StateStore` is the core of EaseRx. It holds the state and provides methods to interact with it. We create a new `StateStore` and wrap it in an `Arc` for sharing across different parts of the application, including different threads.

```rust
use easerx::StateStore;
use std::sync::Arc;

// Create the store with initial state
let store = Arc::new(StateStore::new(Counter::default()));
```

## 3\. Updating and Reading State

EaseRx runs state updates on a worker thread provided by an asynchronous runtime (currently Tokio) to avoid blocking the main thread.

- `set_state`: This method enqueues a function that modifies the state, receiving the current state and returning the new state.
- `with_state`: This method enqueues a function that gets the state, used for one-time access to the state.

```rust
// Enqueue a state update
store.set_state(|state| {
    println!("Worker thread | Updating state...");
    state.add_count(1)
})?;

// Enqueue a state read
store.with_state(|state| {
    println!("Worker thread | Reading state: {:?}", state);
})?;
```

Since these operations are enqueued and executed on a worker thread, they do not block the main thread.

## 4\. Reacting to State Changes

A powerful feature of EaseRx is the ability to react to state changes using signals driven by `futures-signals`.

You can convert the `StateStore` into a signal that emits new states when they change.

```rust
use futures_signals::signal::SignalExt;

// The signal will stop when the count exceeds 100
store
    .to_signal()
    .stop_if(|state| state.count > 100)
    .for_each(|state| {
        println!("Main thread | State changed: {:?}", state);
        async {}
    })
    .await;
```

In this code:

- `to_signal()` creates a signal that broadcasts state changes.
- `stop_if(...)` is an adapter that terminates the signal stream when a condition is met.
- `for_each(...)` is called for each new state emitted by the signal.

This reactive approach allows you to build UIs and other components that automatically update when the underlying data changes.
