# Installation

This section will guide you through setting up EaseRx in your Rust project and writing your first basic application.

## Add Dependencies

To use EaseRx in your project, add the following lines to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
easerx = "0.1.0"
futures-signals = "0.3"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

- **Note**: It is recommended to check and use the latest version of EaseRx on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/easerx).
- **Note**: EaseRx leverages `futures-signals` for reactive programming and `tokio` as an asynchronous runtime. Please ensure these dependencies are included.

## Optional Features

EaseRx provides optional features that can be enabled based on your requirements.

### Serde Support

If you need to serialize or deserialize state, you can enable the `serde` feature. This is useful for saving and loading application state, or for communicating with APIs.

To enable it, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
easerx = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["serde"] }
```

Enabling the `serde` feature allows `Async` and `AsyncError` to support `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`.
