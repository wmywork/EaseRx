# Execute with Retention

This example is based on `extended2_execute_with_retain` and uses `just e2` to run it. It demonstrates how to retain the previous valid value during execution using the `execute_with_retain` method of StateStore, enhancing the user experience.

**Note**: `extended6_async_execute_with_retain` is the asynchronous version, use `just e6` to run this example.

## Usage

- Applicable to scenarios where the UI/state needs to display the last valid data while a new task is executing.
- Commonly used in data refreshing, retries, network requests, etc., to prevent data flickering or loss during the Loading phase.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
store.execute_with_retain(
    || fibonacci_result(1),
    |state| &state.num,
    |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
);
```

## Complete Flow

- During normal execution, the state flow will go through Loading -\> Success.
- If execution fails, the state flow will go through Loading -\> Fail, but will retain the last successful value.
- The field to be retained is specified via `|state| &state.num`.

<!-- end list -->

```rust
let store = Arc::new(StateStore::new(Counter::default()));

store.execute_with_retain(
    || fibonacci_result(93),
    |state| &state.num,
    |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
);
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the state implements `Clone` and that the retained field type supports cloning.
- Recommended for scenarios with high user experience requirements to prevent data loss during the Loading phase.
