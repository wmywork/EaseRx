# Order of Nested Updates

This example is based on `extended1_order_of_nested` and uses `just e1` to run it. It demonstrates the actual execution order of operations when `with_state` and `set_state` are called multiple times in a nested manner within StateStore.

## Usage

- Understand the scheduling order of StateStore's internal task queue to avoid confusion caused by nested calls.
- Applicable to complex scenarios requiring multiple nested read and write operations on the state within the same thread/task.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
info!("Main | A");
with_state(|_w1| {
    debug!("Worker | W1");
    with_state(|_w2| {
        debug!("Worker | W2");
        set_state(|s1| {
            set_state(|s2| {
                set_state(|s3| {
                    debug!("Worker | S3");
                    s3
                });
                debug!("Worker | S2");
                s2
            });
            debug!("Worker | S1");
            s1
        });
    });
});
info!("Main | B");
```

## Order Description

- The output order of the first set of nested calls is: [A, B, W1, W2, S1, S2, S3]
- StateStore internally uses the `Tokio select!` mechanism, and all `with_state`/`set_state` operations are enqueued sequentially.
- In nested calls, the outermost `with_state` is enqueued first, followed by internal `set_state`/`with_state` operations.
- The actual execution order strictly follows the enqueueing order, preventing race conditions and deadlocks.

## Notes

- It is recommended to avoid excessive nesting to keep state operations concise.
- For cross-task/thread collaboration, it is recommended to split operations into multiple independent ones.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
info!("Main | A");
with_state(|_w| {
    debug!("Worker | W");
    with_state(|_w1| {
        debug!("Worker | W1");
    });
    set_state(|s1| {
        debug!("Worker | S1");
        s1
    });
});
info!("Main | B");
```

## Order Description

- The output order for the second set of nested calls is: [A, B, W, S1, W1]
- When `set_state` and `with_state` arrive simultaneously, `set_state` will be executed first to ensure the order of state updates.
