# Multiple State Management

In many applications, you need to manage several independent pieces of state. EaseRx, built on `futures-signals`, makes it easy to combine signals from multiple `StateStore` instances and react to them as a unified stream.

This section is based on the `basic2_multiple_states` example; use `just b2` to run this example.

## Scenario

We will create two independent `StateStore` instances, each managing its own `Counter` state. Our goal is to create a derived view that combines the latest values from both stores and reacts whenever *either* of them changes.

The `Counter` state struct is the same as in the previous example.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
struct Counter {
    count: i32,
}
// ... impl State, impl Counter ...
```

## Combining Signals

The key to this pattern is the `map_ref!` macro from `futures-signals`, which EaseRx re-exports as `combine_state_flow!`. This macro takes multiple signals and combines their latest values into a tuple.

1.  **Create Stores**: We initialize two independent stores.

    ```rust
    let store1 = Arc::new(StateStore::new(Counter { count: 1 }));
    let store2 = Arc::new(StateStore::new(Counter { count: 2 }));
    ```

2.  **Convert to Signals**: We obtain a signal from each store using `to_signal()`.

3.  **Combine with `combine_state_flow!`**: We pass the signals to the macro. The result is a new signal that emits a tuple `(state1, state2)` whenever `store1` or `store2` updates.

    ```rust
    use easerx::combine_state_flow;

    let combined_signal = combine_state_flow!(store1.to_signal(), store2.to_signal());
    ```

## Reacting to Combined State

Once you have a combined signal, you can treat it like any other signal. You can use `for_each` to react to changes or convert it to a stream to process updates in a loop.

### Using `for_each`

This approach is declarative and well-suited for a reactive programming style.

```rust
use futures_signals::signal::SignalExt;

// Spawn a task to update the stores concurrently
// ... (see full example code) ...

println!("Listening for combined state changes...");
combined_signal
    .stop_if(|(state1, state2)| state1.count >= 11 && state2.count >= 12)
    .for_each(|(state1, state2)| async move {
        println!("Combined state: Store1={:?}, Store2={:?}", state1, state2);
    })
    .await;
```

The `for_each` closure will run every time `store1` *or* `store2` changes, providing the latest state of both.

### Using Streams

Alternatively, you can convert the signal into a stream and use a `while let` loop. This might be more convenient for certain imperative logic.

```rust
use futures::StreamExt;

// Spawn another task to update the stores
// ... (see full example code) ...

let mut combined_stream = combined_signal.to_stream();

while let Some((state1, state2)) = combined_stream.next().await {
    println!("Stream update: Store1={:?}, Store2={:?}", state1, state2);
    if state1.count >= 111 && state2.count >= 112 {
        break;
    }
}
```

This pattern is powerful for creating derived data and complex views that depend on multiple independent parts of your application state.
