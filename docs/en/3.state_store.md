# StateStore

`StateStore` is a core component in EaseRx. It is a reactive container responsible for holding application state, handling updates, and managing side effects through various execution methods.

## Architecture

The core of `StateStore` is based on a message-passing architecture. When you create a `StateStore`, it spawns a dedicated background Tokio task. All state modifications and reads are sent as messages to this task via an asynchronous channel (`tokio::sync::mpsc`).

This design offers several key advantages:

- **Thread Safety**: The state is accessed and modified by a single worker task, eliminating the need for manual locking and preventing data races.
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Methods like `set_state` and `with_state` are non-blocking. They simply enqueue an operation and return immediately, keeping the application responsive.
- **Message-Passing Architecture**: State updates are handled via a message-passing mechanism, ensuring thread safety and correct ordering.
- **Ordered Updates**: All operations are processed sequentially in the order they are received, ensuring predictable state transitions.
- **Reactive Interface**: Provides `Signal` and `Stream` interfaces to observe state changes.

## Usage

### Creating a StateStore

- Define `AppState` and implement the `State` trait.
- Create a `StateStore` by providing an initial state.
- It is generally recommended to wrap it in an `Arc` for easy sharing.

```rust
use easerx::{State, StateStore};
use std::sync::Arc;

#[derive(Clone, Default)]
struct AppState { /* ... */ }
impl State for AppState {}

let store = Arc::new(StateStore::new(AppState::default()));
```

### Reading and Writing State

There are several ways to interact with the state:

- `set_state(reducer)`: Enqueues a state update operation. The `reducer` is a function that receives the current state and returns a new state. This is the primary way to modify the state.

  ```rust
  store.set_state(|state| state.update_something())?;
  ```

- `with_state(action)`: Enqueues a read-only operation. The `action` is a function that receives a clone of the current state. It is useful for side effects that need to read the state but not change it.

  ```rust
  store.with_state(|state| {
      println!("Current value: {}", state.value);
  })?;
  ```

- `get_state()`: Synchronously returns a clone of the current state.

  > **Note:** This provides a snapshot. The state might change immediately after the call.

  ```rust
  let current_state = store.get_state();
  ```

- `await_state()`: Asynchronously returns the state after all currently enqueued operations have been processed. This method is useful when you need to ensure you get the most up-to-date state.

  ```rust
  let up_to_date_state = store.await_state().await?;
  ```

### Reacting to Changes

`StateStore` integrates with `futures-signals` to provide a reactive way to observe state changes. This is fundamental for building UIs or other components that automatically reflect the current application state.

- `to_signal()`: Returns a `Signal` that emits the new state when it changes.

```rust
use futures_signals::signal::SignalExt;

let signal = store.to_signal();

signal
    .stop_if(|state| /* Set stop condition */)
    .for_each(|state| {
    // This closure will run every time the state changes
    println!("State updated: {:?}", state);
    async {}
}).await;
```

- `to_stream()`: Converts the signal into a `Stream`.

```rust
use easerx::EaseRxStreamExt;

let stream = store.to_stream();

stream
    .stop_if(|state| /* Set stop condition */)
    .for_each(|state| {
    // This closure will run every time the state changes
    println!("State updated: {:?}", state);
    async {}
}).await;
```
