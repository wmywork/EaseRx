# Synchronous Task Execution

This example, based on `basic4_execute` (run with `just b4`), demonstrates how to execute time-consuming synchronous blocking tasks in a background thread using the `StateStore`'s `execute` method and safely write the results back to the state.

## Scenario Description

- Suitable for scenarios where CPU-intensive or blocking tasks need to be executed in a background thread, and the reactive state needs to be updated upon completion.
- Supports various return types such as plain values, `Result`, and `Option`, which are automatically wrapped as `Async<T>`.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
struct Counter { num: Async<u64> }
impl State for Counter {}

let store = Arc::new(StateStore::new(Counter::default()));
store.execute(
    heavy_computation,
    |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
);
```

## Complete Example

```rust
use easerx::{Async, State, StateStore};
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::time::Duration;
use tokio::time::sleep;
use tracing::info;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
struct Counter { num: Async<u64> }
impl State for Counter {}

fn heavy_computation() -> u64 {
    let mut i: u64 = 0;
    for _ in 0..200_000_000 { i += 1; }
    i
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let store = Arc::new(StateStore::new(Counter::default()));
    let store_clone = store.clone();
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
        store_clone.execute(
            heavy_computation,
            |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
        );
    });
    store.to_signal()
        .stop_if(|state| Async::success(200_000_000) == state.num)
        .for_each(|state| async move {
            info!("State: {:?}", state);
        })
        .await;
}
```

## Considerations

- `execute` is suitable for synchronous blocking tasks; use `async_execute` for asynchronous tasks.
- It is recommended to wrap the state with `Async<T>` to easily track task status.
- Can be combined with `to_signal().for_each()` to implement reactive UIs or real-time monitoring.
