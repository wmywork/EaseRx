# Non-Blocking Execution

This example is based on `extended10_execution_without_blocking` and demonstrates the difference between `execute` and `async_execute` when executing CPU-intensive tasks. Run this example with `just e10`.

## Usage

- When executing CPU-intensive tasks, `execute` will not block other asynchronous tasks.
- `async_execute`, however, will block other asynchronous tasks until the task is complete.
- When designing applications that require CPU-intensive tasks, it is recommended to use the `execute` method.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
//#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
// Configures the tokio runtime to be in current_thread mode,
// where all tasks run on the same thread.

// First, create a few asynchronous tasks
for i in 0..2 {
        let handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
            normal_function(i).await;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

// Then execute a time-consuming computation task
tokio::spawn(async move {
    store_clone.execute(
        heavy_computation,
        |state, num| {
            debug!("Worker | update num: {:?}", num);
            Counter { num, ..state }
        },
    );
});

for handle in handles {
    handle.await.unwrap();
}

// The execute time-consuming computation will not block other asynchronous tasks.
// While heavy_computation is executing, normal_function can continue to run.
// Therefore, heavy_computation will output its result only after normal_function has completed.
```
