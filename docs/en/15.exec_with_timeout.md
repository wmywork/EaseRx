# Execution with Timeout

This example is based on `extended5_execute_with_timeout` and demonstrates how to achieve cancellable tasks with timeout using the `execute_with_timeout` method of StateStore. Run this example with `just e5`.

**Note**: `extended9_async_execute_with_timeout` is the asynchronous version of this example, run it with `just e9`.

## Usage

- Suitable for scenarios where tasks need to be cancellable with a timeout.

## Key Code Snippet

```rust
let cancellation_token = CancellationToken::new();
store.execute_cancellable_with_retain(
    cancellation_token.clone(),
    |token| heavy_computation_cancellable(token),
    |state| &state.num,
    |state, num| Counter { num, ..state }
);
```

## Complete Flow

- In normal execution, the state flow goes from Loading -\> Success.
- If the task times out, the state flow goes from Loading -\> Fail, and the error will be `AsyncError::Timeout`.
